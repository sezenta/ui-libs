## FormSchema interface

This take an array of ```FormField```. i.e. ```FormField[]```.

## Why Dynamic Schema Form?

In the development of web applications, form creation is a fundamental yet often complex task. Forms are the primary method for collecting user input, and their significance cannot be overstated. However, as applications grow in complexity, so does the challenge of managing forms that are responsive, user-friendly, and efficient. This is where our Dynamic Schema Form Library comes in, addressing several critical needs:

### Simplified Form Management

By defining forms through JSON Schema, developers can abstract the form layout and validation logic from the UI code. This separation simplifies form management, allowing for quick adjustments to form fields, validation rules, and appearance without deep dives into the UI codebase.

### Enhanced User Experience

Dynamic forms adapt to user input in real-time, providing an interactive and intuitive user experience. Whether it's conditionally showing or hiding fields, dynamically adjusting options, or providing instant validation feedback, our library ensures users have a seamless and efficient interaction with your application.

### Reduced Development Time

With the Dynamic Schema Form Library, the time and effort required to create and maintain forms are significantly reduced. Developers can focus on the schema definition, and the library takes care of rendering the form UI, managing state, and handling validations. This efficiency accelerates the development process, allowing teams to deliver features faster.

### Increased Consistency and Reliability

Utilizing JSON Schema as the foundation for form creation promotes consistency across your application's forms. It ensures that data validation follows a standardized approach, reducing errors and improving data integrity. Moreover, by centralizing the form definitions, your application gains in maintainability and scalability.

## Key Features

- **JSON Schema Compatibility**: Fully supports JSON Schema for defining form structure and validation, offering a versatile and powerful way to describe your forms.
- **Dynamic Form Generation**: Automatically generates forms based on your JSON Schema definition, including complex nested structures and arrays.
- **Real-time Validation**: Provides immediate feedback on user input based on the validation rules defined in the JSON Schema, enhancing the user experience.
- **Conditional Logic**: Supports conditional fields and sections, allowing forms to adapt based on user input and ensuring that users are only presented with relevant questions.
- **Customizable UI**: While the library handles the heavy lifting, it offers flexibility in styling and customizing the appearance of your forms to match your application's design system.
